# Students-Dropout-Prediction
Towards Predicting Student's Dropout in University Courses Using Different Machine Learning Techniques 

## Algorithms
There are six python notebooks (files with extension .ipynb) containing all tested algorithms

## Data
There are two **CSV** files contaning data used by the algorithms
File *DBS.csv* contains 3 years worth of data from online course (years 2016-2019)
File *DBS_2020.csv* contains the most recent data from last year of the online course (year 2020)
